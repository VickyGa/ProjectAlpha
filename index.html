      <h3>Opportunity</h3>
      <p>Launch Date: July 07, 2003, landed:January 25, 2004 - Mission End Date: June 10, 2018. 
        The second of two rovers launched in 2003 to land on Mars. Opportunity began traversing the Red Planet in search of signs of past life and far outlasted its planned 90-day mission. It made a number of discoveries about the Red Planet including evidence that long ago at least one area of Mars stayed wet for an extended period and that conditions could have been suitable for sustaining microbial life. Opportunity stopped communicating with Earth when a severe Mars-wide dust storm blanketed its location in June 2018.</p>

      <h3>Spirit</h3>
      <p>Launch Date: June 10,2003, landed: January 4, 2004 - Mission End Date: May 25, 2011. Opportunity's twin rover, Spirit far outlasted its planned 90-day mission. Among her myriad discoveries, Spirit found evidence that Mars was once much wetter than it is today and helped scientists better understand the Martian wind.In May 2009, the rover became embedded in soft soil with only five working wheels to aid in the rescue effort. NASA ended efforts to free the rover and eventually ended the mission on May 25, 2011.</p>

      <h3>Curiosity</h3>
      <p>Launch Date: Nov. 26, 2011, landed: August 6, 201. As of March 9, 2020, the rover is still operational, and has been on Mars for 2771 total days. The rover's goals include an investigation of the Martian climate, Martian geology and determining if environmental conditions are favorable for microbial life. It also conducts planetary habitability studies in preparation for human exploration.</p>
