1. Title: Mars Rovers

2. This app will show the user pictures of Mars taken from 2004 to today by the rovers NASA sent to the planet. The user will be able to pick one of the three rovers: Curiosity, Opportunity, or Spirit. The user will enter a date. The search will return pictures taken by the rover on the chosen day.
The user will also be able to watch two YouTube videos showing mars landscape.

5 MVP.
My goals are:
             to use: 
HTML for content,
CSS + flexbox or grid for style,  
JavaScript for functionality (drop-down menus, clickable links),
Media queries to have the app work on different screen sizes,
             to host the app on Surge
             to develop this README file.
             to have GitHub commits every day.
